# Part1
 For this part of the project, my strategy was to have one of the guests be the only one who could eat a cupcake, and every guest could only eat one cupcake.
 This way, whenever the designated guest had to replace a cupcake, he would know that a new person who had not eaten a cupcake before ate a cupcake. By making
 sure that every guest ate a cupcake, we can then know that every guest entered the labyrinth without having the guests communicate. I tested the code multiple  times with different threads and the thread behavior matches that of how the guests would behave using the strategy I mentioned above. To avoud race conditions  since multiple threads #are sharing resources, I used a lock whenever one of the guests enters the labyrinth. This not only ensures that the resources aren't   corrupted or changed improperly, but also to properly simulate that only one guest is in the labyrinth at once, making the code behave correctly.
